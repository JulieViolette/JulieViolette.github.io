    <p>Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?</p>
    <p>It was 21 years ago mother spoke to me,
        And said the duration of the seed to the root of our family tree
        Was struck with the curse of the witches
        Blackened and evil.
        They were then proved and condemned by the Quakers and Puritans.
        <p>'I thought our branches and sprouts were ever clear, but one leaf is dark.'</p>
        With tear in eye, and heart of love, she said she would leave.
        Then with a questioned expression she asked, 'Do you believe?'</p>
        <p> She was sentenced by her accusers, to be secretly burned to the stake,
        Till death comes.</p>
        <p>But as the years went by, everything got so much better for me,
        I found a wife who had my child, they were good and healthy and we got so wealthy,
        Once strange thing happened though,
        As my daughter reached six years old
        She had trouble getting along with one boy who sang the song
        She then wished that he would die
        And the next day he was dead.</p>
        <p>The people of the town said she must pay
        For having the curse of the witch she must be burned at the stake
        Her mother and I we fought and screamed for her to live
        But when the judge had his say, quote: 'To end her curse-filled life, she must die...'</p>
        <p>With tears in eye and hearts of love, we should said she had to leave
        Then with a questioned expression she asked, 'Do you believe?'</p>
        <p>She was sentenced by her accusers to be secretly burned to the stake
        Till death comes.</p>
        <p>Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?</p>
        <p>My wife, she couldn't take it, her heart was much too weak
        It was the day her heart stopped beating I knew it was too late.
        Without a friend to talk to there is no reason to speak
        The love I had for the town had completely turned to hate.</p>
        <p>With tear in eye and no heart at all, I knew I would leave
        Then looked, looked up to the sky and asked,
        'Who can I believe?'</p>
        <p> Everything hurts so much I can't take it,
        To be happy I'll have to wait till death comes.</p>
